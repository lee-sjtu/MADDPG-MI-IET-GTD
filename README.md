# MADDPG-MI-IET-GTD

MADDPG-MI is a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorhtim proposed in [IET Generation, Transmission & Distribution â€“ H. Li et al.: Decentralized Collaborative Optimal Scheduling for EV Charging Stations Based on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning], which is based on the traditional MADDPG algorithm. In the comparisons of the algorithm, the traditional MADDPG, VDN, and QMIX algorithms have been used.
